            For this project, our team was tasked to develop our own digital service innovation. Through domain
            research, customer interviews, and multiple rounds of reviews, our team narrowed the goal of our design to
            better bridge the gap between customers, shop-owners and salespeople in the context of online shopping. As a
            solution, we came up with a service that connects Etsy/Shopify owners to freelance salespeople in order to
            live stream high-ticket products on their website, personally connect with customers, and enhance their
            e-commerce presence.

          At the beginning of the project, our initial idea was to help artist connect with businesses and apply their
          creative skills in non-traditional applications.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row align-items-center">
        <p>
          We first completed the reverse assumption activity to brainstorm and consolidate a series of possible problem
          statements to guide our research. Some statements that our team shared collective interests on are:
        </p>
        <div class="col-md-5">
          <img src="../Assets/images/skysales/opportunity framing/of-1.png" alt="icon of reverse assumption"

          <span class="row summary-title-light">1. Reverse Assumption</span>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-7">
          <p class="summary-title-light">How might we help connect artists to spark more creativity needed by the
            industries?</p>
          <p class="summary-title-light">How might we enable artists to apply their skills to different industries
            outside their immediate field?</p>
          <p class="summary-title-light">How might we show the value that artists can provide businesses?</p>

      </div>

      <div class="row align-items-center">
        <p>
          Keeping these problem statements in mind, we then take a look into the competitive landscape for our proposed
          service through conducting Competitor Analysis. And we identified three main types of competition:
        </p>

        <div class="col-md-5">
          <img src="../Assets/images/skysales/opportunity framing/of-2.png" alt="competitor analysis visualization"

          <p class="summary-title-light">3. Skill-sharing Platforms. </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row align-items-center">
        <p>
          The competitor Analysis not only helped us understand our company positioning in the bigger landscape, it also
          led to our first pivot: we changed from our previous focus on helping artists to helping people experiencing
          career pivot in general. Our team then performed PESTLE and SET analysis to further research on the details
          that will support and influence our service, which led to our first Product Opportunity Gap:
        </p>
        <div class="col-md-5">
          <img src="../Assets/images/skysales/opportunity framing/of-3.png" alt="competitor analysis visualization"

        <div class="col-md-7">
          <p class="summary-title-light">A service that provides skill-based insights into job-seeking individuals as
            they pivot in their careers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row align-items-center">
          <p>
            However, we soon realized we are trying to tackle too broad of a problem with this POG statement. And we
            pivoted again to narrow our focus on providing help to retail salespeople, which is one of the most
            influenced careers by COVID 19 pandemic. We then reconducted our PESTLE and SET analysis, which naturally
            led us to our second Product Opportunity Gap:

          Our proposed service has three stakeholders involved: online shopper, shop owner, and the salespeople. To
          better support our MVP design, we need to understand the journey and pain points for all three parties
          involved. Through conducting semi structured interviews, contextual inquiry, direct observations and online
          surveys, we are able to get the following insights:

          It took us three pivots to land on our final MVP service: From helping artists match their skillset to other
          types of work, to helping people pivot their career in general, then to a live-stream shopping service, and
          finally narrowed to outsourcing sales expert for small online shop owners.

          The final MVP we are proposing is Skysales: a media service that connects Etsy/Shopify owners to freelance
          salespeople in order to live stream high-ticket products on their website, personally connect with
          customers, and enhance their e-commerce presence.

        <p>
          To better demonstrate our customer’s journey using Skysales, we developed a concept video to be played
          during the investor showcase. We then formulated the rest of our pitch presentation to provide any
          supporting information that’s not mentioned in the video.
